Revisium is a tool (UI/API) inspired by JSON (JSON Schema) and Git, designed to provide a flexible and low-level headless CMS solution. **This project originated from a closed-source repository** where it was developed over the course of a year and a half as a proof of concept. I am now making it open source to foster community involvement, transparency, and collaborative improvement.

## About

Revisium leverages the power of JSON schemas and the concepts of version control systems similar to Git to offer a robust framework for content management. Whether you're building a simple website or a complex application, Revisium can serve as the backbone for your content infrastructure, allowing for seamless integration and customization.
